Casino Game Viewer – Development Plan
Based on the PRD, this step-by-step plan outlines the development of a 3D casino game visualization system.

🧱 Phase 1: Setup and Data Processing
🔧 Project Structure Setup
Create a new project directory.

Set up a Python virtual environment.

Install necessary libraries:

pandas, numpy, scikit-learn for data processing.

plotly, dash for visualization.

📊 Data Analysis
Load and examine the CSV data from:

swift
Copy
Edit
/Users/osulldan/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheStarsGroup/Desktop/Windsurf_agent_test/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project/Data/BigGameBoard.csv
Clean and preprocess the data.

Identify key metrics for visualization.

🧠 Embedding Generation
Extract text features from game descriptions/reviews.

Generate embeddings using suitable models:

Use OpenAI's API to generate embeddings. However, only run this for 100 text records. From here, calculate a cost of creating embeddings for the rest of the data and ask if we would like to proceed on this.

Reduce dimensionality to 3D using techniques like:

PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP.

Cluster the embeddings using algorithms such as:

K-means or DBSCAN.

📈 Phase 2: Visualization Development
🖼️ 3D Visualization Framework
Set up a web-based framework using Dash with Plotly.

Create a basic 3D scatter plot with the embeddings.

Apply color coding based on clusters or other game attributes.

🧭 Interactive Features
Implement hover functionality to display game name and user scores.

Add controls for rotation, zoom, and pan in the 3D space.

Create filters for different game attributes.

Implement smooth animations and transitions.

🎨 Phase 3: UI Enhancement and Deployment
💅 Visual Design
Apply professional styling with a casino theme.

Optimize the layout for both desktop and mobile devices.

Add attractive visual elements (e.g., particle effects, glow).

🛠️ Usability Features
Add search functionality.

Implement save/export options for visualizations.

Create dashboards with key metrics for quick insights.

🧪 Testing and Optimization
Test performance with the full dataset.

Optimize rendering and interaction speed.

Gather feedback and make improvements.

📚 Documentation
Create comprehensive documentation.

Add a user guide for both technical and non-technical users.

🚀 Implementation Approach
Utilize Python as the primary language for data processing.

Leverage modern web technologies for frontend visualization.

Focus on visual appeal for the Director of Casino while ensuring analytical utility for the Analyst.

Prioritize smooth, responsive interactivity.
