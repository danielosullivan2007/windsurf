# Casino Game Embeddings Exploration

## Overview
This document outlines the key findings from our analysis of casino game embeddings generated using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model.

## Embedding Characteristics
- **Total Games**: 3,549
- **Embedding Dimensions**: 1,536
- **Generation Cost**: $0.35

## Analysis Techniques
1. **Clustering Analysis**
   - Used K-means clustering
   - Determined optimal number of clusters
   - Visualized clusters in 3D space

2. **Semantic Similarity**
   - Calculated cosine similarity between game embeddings
   - Identified similar games within clusters

## Key Insights
### Clustering
- Identified multiple distinct game clusters
- Each cluster represents games with semantic similarities
- Potential groupings based on:
  - Game type
  - Thematic elements
  - Descriptive language

### Semantic Relationships
- Discovered games with high semantic similarity
- Revealed underlying patterns in game descriptions
- Potential use cases:
  - Recommendation systems
  - Game categorization
  - Market analysis

## Visualization
- Interactive 3D scatter plot: `game_clusters_3d.html`
- Allows exploration of game embeddings
- Color-coded by cluster

## Next Steps
1. Refine clustering techniques
2. Develop game recommendation algorithm
3. Create interactive exploration tool

## Technical Details
- Clustering Algorithm: K-means
- Dimensionality Reduction: PCA
- Similarity Metric: Cosine Similarity

## Limitations
- Embeddings based on text descriptions
- May not capture all nuanced game characteristics
- Requires human interpretation
